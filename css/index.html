      <h1>Eneias Júnior</h1>
      <h2>Electrical Engineer | UI Designer | Front-end developer</h2>

      <p>I am searching for a new opportunity to keep improving my skills and discovering new ones. In my last job I
        have developed UI skills, hence I am interested in working as UI/UX Designer or as another role in a PO team.
        Nowadays, I am studying front-end programming (HTML, CSS, JS and frameworks) because I would like to tie my UI
        knowledges with it, then, I am open for an front-end developer opportunity as well. </p>
      <p>This site portifolio is the beginning of the practical journey!</p>
